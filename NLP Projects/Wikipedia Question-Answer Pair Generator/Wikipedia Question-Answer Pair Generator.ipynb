    "The selected pre-trained model for this task is **google/flan-t5-large**, downloaded from Hugging Face. Flan-t5 (Fine-tuned Language Net-T5) is an enhanced version of the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model. The T5 model is pre-trained on a mixture of different NLP tasks, where each task can be represented in a text-to-text format. Thus, the T5 model can be used for a variety of NLP tasks by appending a different prefix corresponding to the task required. For example, the prompt prefix 'Ask question' has been appended in this use case to generate a question from an input text from Wikipedia. The Flan-t5 model is an enhanced version of the T5 model that has been fine-tuned on additional instruction-based NLP tasks, with improved performance on a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flan-t5 model was chosen for the following key reasons:\n",
    "1. It is a state of the art text-to-text NLP model that was recently released in 2022, and has been compared to GPT-3. It performs well on a wide range of NLP tasks, including question answering.\n",
    "2. It was fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data (Flan collection of datasets) which includes Wikipedia data. Since the task involves question-answer generation on Wikipedia text, using a model that has been pre-trained on Wikipedia data is ideal.\n",
    "3. It is open-source, designed to be customizable, and readily available from Hugging Face."
