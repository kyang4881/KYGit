The provided Jupyter Notebook defines a pipeline for extracting text from a Wikipedia URL, pre-processing the text, and generating question-answer pairs using a large language model, specifically the Flan-T5 model. The pipeline consists of four classes: extractText for retrieving and processing text from a Wikipedia page, preprocessText for cleaning and validating the extracted text, generateQA for generating question-answer pairs using the Flan-T5 model, and runPipeline to orchestrate the entire process, including saving the results to a CSV file.
